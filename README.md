# E-commerce product page

This project is a E-commerce product page, I made it just for a simple challenge by [Frontend mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io?ref=challenge).
This is a main challenge [Website](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6)
This is my [Solution](https://sitecom.vercel.app)

If you wanna make some changes, you will need to install **sass** perprocessor as global by typing:

```sh
npm i -g sass
```

This step is (**Optional**), you can edit directly style of page in style/css/main.css file, but not recommanded.

After install sass type

```sh
sass --watch styles/sass/main.scss styles/css/main.css
```

The **sass** will watch any changes you made in **.scss** files.
